            <h2>User Case</h2>
            <p>Letters. is a social media app I designed that brings back the charm of letter writing in the digital age. Each user's page is like a personal diary, filled with long-form letters that resemble blog posts, complete with beautiful typography and embedded images. The app encourages thoughtful communication by starting each letter with a salutation, creating a personal and intimate experience for both writers and readers. Users can respond to letters with their own, forming a thread-like conversation that feels more meaningful than typical social media interactions. Letters. also features AI-assisted writing tools, helping users craft their messages with creativity and ease. The design emphasizes aesthetics, creating a space where the art of letter writing can thrive in a modern, connected world.</p>
