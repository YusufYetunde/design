            <h3 class="title-sec">About</h3>
            <p>I began my journey in product design recently, and since then, I've been on a path of continuous learning
                and improvement. My passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing designs has driven me to
                rapidly develop my skills and tackle various projects, from mobile apps to innovative digital platforms.
                Each project has been an opportunity to refine my understanding of user experience, interface design, and
                the creative process. As I continue to learn and grow, I'm excited to push the boundaries of what's
                possible in product design and create solutions that not only meet user needs but also inspire and
                delight.</p>
